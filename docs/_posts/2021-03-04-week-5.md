 Hello readers!
 
 This week I have not been able to progress properly because I still do not have a computer to work properly so I have only done:
 
- Use elasticsearch in Django, using django-elasticsearch-dsl and the admin to handle the data
The result of using elasticsearch with django:

  {% include gallery %}
