 Hello readers!
 
 This week I have done the following tasks:
 
-I have adapted elasticsearch dummy so that it shows all the exercises and has the same fields that will be collected in the platform
-I have organized the code for collecting probes and have succeeded in capturing the abrupt closings probes
-I have investigated the use of dash to display probes
-I have added the new exercises to the probe collection
