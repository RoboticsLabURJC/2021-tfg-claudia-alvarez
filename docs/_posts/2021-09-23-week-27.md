 Hello readers!
 
This week I have advanced in the TFG doing:
 
- A filter in which the staff can see the scores in the exercises of each user in addition to their own scores

- A link in Unibotics to access the Dash page where the graphs are

- Elasticsearch dummy has been modified to add these new probes.

- Research on Latex to make the TFG memory
