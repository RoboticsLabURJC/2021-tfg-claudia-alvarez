 Hello readers!
 
 This week I have done the following tasks:
 
-I have captured new probes in the Unibotics-webserver code where the end and start of session data are saved with the username in an index and in another index the end of exercise is saved plus the previously captured probe of the start of exercise and the username. It would be necessary to save the end of the session with abrupt closings, such as the window closing or the browser closing
-I have also investigated to create an elasticsearch dummy, I just need to improve the code to make it coherent with the real data that will be captured in unibotics
