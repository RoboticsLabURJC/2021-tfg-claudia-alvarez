Hello readers!

My first step this week was to create this blog with GithubPages where I will publish all the progress in my TFG.
In order to be able to introduce myself to the subject of my TFG I have read Angel Perea's TFG since the subject of his work is similar to mine
also I reaserch about ElasticSerach  and I have continued looking at information from docker container

see you the next week!!
